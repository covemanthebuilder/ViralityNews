## 0. Title Page & Abstract

**Title:** **ViralityNews: A Decentralized Analytics Layer for Social‑Driven Prediction Markets**\
**Version:** v0.9‑draft • **Date:** July 2025 • **Authors:** Jack Covell

**Abstract**\
Prediction markets excel at aggregating crowd wisdom into probabilities, yet they react *after* narratives capture public attention. Simultaneously, social platforms from X/Twitter to Farcaster surface breaking information faster than legacy media, but remain noisy, siloed, and prone to manipulation. ViralityNews bridges this gap. We ingest high‑velocity social‑engagement data, quantify its *virality*, correlate those signals with live odds across binary and categorical markets, and publish auditable insights via pay‑as‑you‑go micro‑transactions. Built on the Coinbase Developer Platform (x402, Base, Server Wallets, Embedded Wallets, OnchainKit), ViralityNews delivers transparent, AI‑driven, and verifiable news analytics designed for traders, journalists, and autonomous agents.

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Declining Trust in Legacy Media

Gallup’s 2024 poll showed only **32 %** of Americans trust mass media “a great deal or fair amount.” Similar trends appear globally, eroding the authority of traditional newsrooms and polls.

### 1.2 The Speed Asymmetry

Citizen‑journalists and influencers on X/Twitter, TikTok, and emerging decentralized platforms such as Farcaster frequently break stories *minutes* (sometimes hours) before legacy outlets. Yet prediction‑market odds and institutional decision‑making lag because practitioners cannot quickly separate signal from noise.

### 1.3 Fragmented & Noisy Information

Raw feeds produce duplicate posts, bot spam, and contradictory narratives, making quantitative analysis difficult without proprietary tooling.

### 1.4 AI‑Enabled Opportunity

Recent advances in NLP (transformer‑based embeddings), streaming time‑series models, and onchain indexing enable a transparent layer that translates engagement data into measurable insight.

### 1.5 Mission

ViralityNews ingests heterogeneous data, applies open AI scoring, correlates virality with market repricing, and distributes cryptographically verifiable, monetizable signals, eliminating reliance on gate‑kept channels.

## 2. Background & Related Work

### 2.1 Prediction‑Market Evolution

*Iowa Electronic Markets* pioneered academic crowd forecasting, *InTrade* commercialized the concept, *Augur* created the first decentralized version, and, most recently, *Polymarket* propelled prediction markets into the mainstream zeitgeist as a decentralized truth-seeking protocol. While these platforms price probabilities, they do not incorporate social sentiment quantitatively.

### 2.2 Social‑Data Platforms

Tools like *Google Trends*, *The Tie*, and *LunarCrush* measure engagement but provide no causal linkage to market odds and rely on centralized APIs.

### 2.3 Decentralized Oracles

Oracles such as Chainlink and Pyth focus on financial price feeds, lacking granularity for high‑frequency sentiment or multi‑outcome markets.

### 2.4 Academic Findings

Research shows Twitter sentiment Granger‑causes Bitcoin returns. However, studies use pairwise correlations, overlook categorical prediction markets, and rarely anchor results onchain for auditability.

### 2.5 Gap

ViralityNews uniquely **quantifies virality**, **time‑aligns engagement deltas with odds shifts**, and **monetizes via an API‑first model** underpinned by onchain proofs.

## 3. Market Analysis & Use Cases

### 3.1 Total Addressable Market (2025)

- **Sports & political betting:** ≈ \$115 B
- **Social/news analytics:** ≈ \$30 B
- **Legacy media:** ≈ \$180 B\
  **Total:** ≈ \$325 B

### 3.2 Personas & Pain Points

| Persona                      | Pain                                                  | ViralityNews Benefit                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quant & event‑driven traders | Need early signals to capture edge before books move  | Minute‑level odds‑virality correlation feed, webhook alerts     |
| Newsrooms & journalists      | Thin fact‑checking resources, fear of missing stories | Ranked feed of breakout narratives with market‑based confidence |
| AI/ML developers             | Require structured, real‑time probabilities           | JSON/GraphQL API; agent‑friendly schemas                        |
| Corporate risk teams         | Monitor reputational & geopolitical shifts            | Dashboards & Slack alerts tied to relevant markets              |

### 3.3 Competitive Landscape

Alt‑data vendors deliver metrics, prediction dashboards deliver odds, but none combine both in a verifiable, pay‑per‑call model. Legacy terminals remain expensive and slow. ViralityNews sits at the intersection, using **x402** for micro‑billing and Base anchors for trust.

### 3.4 Regulatory Tailwinds

CFTC no‑action relief legitimizes small‑stake political markets; EU MiCA clarifies oracle obligations; the Digital Services Act demands algorithmic transparency, creating demand for auditable data layers like ViralityNews.

## 4. High‑Level Architecture

### 4.1 Component Overview

1. **Ingestion Layer** — Subgraph pulls for onchain odds; Firehose ingestion of X/Twitter, Reddit, Farcaster, RSS.
2. **Data Lake (EigenCloud)** — Decentralized, verifiable object store; daily snapshots pinned to IPFS.
3. **Analytics Engine** — Runs transformer‑based sentiment classifiers and time‑series models within EigenCloud secure enclaves; outputs *ViralityScore* and *CorrelationIndex*.
4. **Payments Gateway (x402)** — Pay‑per‑call billing in USDC; integrated **Onramp/Offramp widget** permits fiat top‑ups.
5. **Application Layer** — React dashboard (OnchainKit UI), GraphQL/REST API, WebSocket streams.
   - **Embedded Wallet Service** stores user USDC via passkeys.
   - **AgentKit Chatbot** inside The Base App for conversational queries.
6. **Integrity Proofs** — Merkle root of each 5‑min batch posted to **Base L2**, signed via **CDP Server Wallet**.
7. **CDP Node RPC** — Primary endpoint for submits/reads; backup RPC cluster.
8. **Governance Layer** — Multisig initially; DAO post‑token.

## 5. Core Protocol Mechanics (MVP)

### 5.1 Data Model

- **Post**: {id, author, timestamp, platform, engagement metrics}
- **Market**: {id, contract address, outcome set, price, volume}
- **ViralityScore**: weighted function of velocity, breadth, sentiment
- **CorrelationIndex**: time‑aligned coefficient between ViralityScore delta and price delta

#### Methodology Overview

- **Linking posts to markets** — Named‑entity recognition and fuzzy matching connect social content  with market metadata (outcome names, tickers, event dates). Ambiguous matches are discarded or queued for manual review.
- **Scoring & correlation** — A transformer‑based sentiment model and engagement‑velocity features generate *ViralityScore* every minute. A rolling lead/lag regression maps changes in ViralityScore to subsequent price moves, yielding a *CorrelationIndex* in \([-1,1]\).

### 5.2 Integrity Proofs

Every minute‑level dataset is hashed; five hashes form a Merkle tree. The root, timestamp, and IPFS CID are posted to Base. Clients receive inclusion proofs in API headers.

### 5.3 Signal Lifecycle

1. **On‑Ramp & Funding** — User purchases USDC via CDP Onramp API widget; USDC settles in embedded wallet.
2. **Ingest & Store** — Aggregators push raw data to EigenCloud.
3. **Compute & Anchor** — Secure enclave jobs produce metrics; Merkle root posted to Base.
4. **Deliver & Bill** — User request triggers x402 charge; payload streamed with proof.

### 5.4 Economic Logic (MVP)

- All x402 revenue accumulates in a Server Wallet‑controlled USDC treasury.
- Budget allocations: 10 % compute subsidy, 10 % contingency, 80 % growth & ops.

### 5.5 Future Decentralisation (v2+)

External providers, validator‑signed anchors, \$VNEWS staking, and a real‑time oracle feed for DeFi.

## 7. Governance Roadmap

Initially governed by a **3‑of‑5 multisig**; quarterly transparency reports and public RFCs. DAO triggers: ≥ 1,000 paying clients or ≥ \$100 k MRR, \$VNEWS launch, and ≥ 5 validators. Future two‑chamber DAO will oversee upgrades, fees, and treasury.

---

## 8. Security & Risk Analysis

- **Data Integrity** — Cross‑source checks; Merkle proofs on Base.
- **Compute Integrity** — EigenCloud attestation; reproducible builds.
- **Wallet & Payment Security** — CDP Embedded Wallets + x402.
- **Model Robustness** — Adversarial training; anomaly detection.
- **Operational Resilience** — 24‑h circuit‑breaker; multi‑region ingestion nodes.
- **Audit Plan** — Smart‑contract, infra, and ML model audits prior to Mainnet.

## 12. References & Appendices

## Appendix A — Technical Methodology

### A.1 Post‑to‑Market Linking

1. **Entity Extraction** – Named‑entity recognition (NER) detects tickers, candidate names, team names, and key phrases in post text.
2. **Fuzzy Matching** – String‑similarity and vector search map extracted entities to market metadata (outcome titles, descriptions, tags).
3. **Confidence Scoring** – Matches scoring ≥ 0.85 are accepted automatically; 0.70–0.85 enter a review queue; below 0.70 are dropped.
4. **Caching** – Accepted mappings are cached for 24 hours to reduce compute overhead.

### A.2 ViralityScore v0.1 (Conceptual)

ViralityScore combines three normalized components:

- **Velocity** – Rate of new engagements per minute.
- **Breadth** – Diversity of unique accounts engaging, adjusted for follower‑count percentile.
- **Weighted Sentiment** – Transformer sentiment score weighted by account influence.
  Calibrated coefficients balance these components using historical ridge regression.

### A.3 CorrelationIndex v0.1 (Conceptual)

1. Build a 20‑minute rolling window of ViralityScore and price changes per market.
2. Run an ordinary least squares lead/lag regression of price deltas on lagged ViralityScore deltas.
3. Output a signed correlation coefficient (range ‑1 to 1) plus a p‑value from a Granger‑causality test, classifying confidence as Strong, Moderate, or Weak.

### A.4 Data‑Quality Filters

- Bot‑score threshold below 0.3 using a Botometer‑style classifier.
- Trim extreme engagement‑to‑follower ratios above the 99.5th percentile.
- Remove duplicate or near‑duplicate content hashes.
